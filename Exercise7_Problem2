#set lists for sequence length, GC content
#calculate sequence lengths, append to list
#calculate GC content, append to list
#possibly makes lists into dataframe? #not sure #may be able to just plot from list variable?
#use ggplot to make histogram, set x axis as sequence length and GC content for each histogram respectively


#Work through for Exercise7_Problem2
#Use Flu_data.csv (comma separated)
    #Note - Column0 is age group information
    #Note - Each column is a different year data was collected, but did not include years in the data set.
