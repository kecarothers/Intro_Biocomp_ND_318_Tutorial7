#Pseudo code Part 1
#import packages (os, numpy, pandas, plotnine (from plotnine import *))
#open file for Lecture11.fasta
#set lists for sequence length, GC content
#calculate sequence lengths, append to list
#calculate GC content, append to list
#possibly makes lists into dataframe? #not sure #may be able to just plot from list variable?
#use ggplot to make histogram, set x axis as sequence length and GC content for each histogram respectively

#Work through for Exercise7_Problem2
#Use Flu_data.csv (comma separated)
    #Note - there is no info in Row0,Coloumn0
    #Note - Column0 is age group information
    #Note - Row0 is year data was collected
#Pseudo-code = Hannah
#Code = Katelyn

#import needed packages (numpy, pandas, plotnine)
#read data file
#plot hospitalizations vs year
    #Note - need some sort of way to differentiate between the age categories (column0)
